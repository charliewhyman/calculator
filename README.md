## Introduction

This project is a first attempt at using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a simple application. The calculator will contain functions for all of the basic math operators you typically find on simple calculators, i.e.:
* add
* subtract
* multiply
* divide

The calculator will also contain a display to show the user's inputs, and the calculation results.
